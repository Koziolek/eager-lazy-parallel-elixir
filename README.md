# EagerLazyParallel

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

  1. Add eager_lazy_parallel to your list of dependencies in mix.exs:

        def deps do
          [{:eager_lazy_parallel, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure eager_lazy_parallel is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:eager_lazy_parallel]]
        end
